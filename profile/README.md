[OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/) is committed to working both upstream and with existing communities to advance open source security for all.

We foster collaboration, establish best practices, and develop innovative solutions to secure the development, maintenance, and consumption of open source software. OpenSSF is part of the nonprofit [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org/).
